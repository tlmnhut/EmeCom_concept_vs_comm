# Emergence of language: the effect of visual concepts on communication

This project investigates the effect of conceptualization on the emergence of language in a referential game.
- input_bin.ipynb: train agents from binary vectors.
- input_image.ipynb: train agents from raw images.
- compare_representation.ipynb: compare the quality of conceptualization on different binary vectors, and features learned from scratch.

[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QVMYlpRjY2NdSKecp1XB_GOmFjbnErqm?usp=sharing) the data and model, then put the two folder "data" and "save" to the same directory of this readme file.

The code was adapted from [EGG](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG) framework. Python version: 3.6.

TODO:

- Increase the accuracy of training from scratch.
- Move to fully unsupervised learning by using autoencoders.
